# This project was created by Alec Rothenberg and Lucas Pereira 
# In this project we have created a graph containing more than 100,000 cast and crew members from almost 5000 movies. Each vertex represents an a cast or crew member and each edge 
# represents a movie they have woroked in together.
# Each edge gets "stronger" if the actors have worked togheter in multiple movies.
# The purpose of this project is to test vairous shortest path algortihim on our grpah and determine what kind of relation two actors have to one another.
